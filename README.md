# US Influenza Season Staffing Project
This project was conducted as part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program.

## Objective  
Every year in the US, extra demands are placed on hospitals and clinics during flu season, leading to staffing shortages and undesirable health outcomes because of those staffing shortages. My goal was to help mitigate medical staffing shortages in hospitals and clinics across the US during flu season. By using deaths and population data, I determined the areas of greatest need, so the correct amount of staff could be sent at the right times of the year.
