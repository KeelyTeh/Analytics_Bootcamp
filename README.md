# Natality Project
This project was conducted as part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program. However, all students chose their own data set for this project.

## Objective
Each year women experience abnormal infant birth weights and gestation times, which puts them and their newborns in danger. A government medical agency wants to better understand the factors leading to untimely deliveries, so they can help ensure normal birth weights and gestation.

## Data
CDC natality data was used for this project. This data set comprises information on the following parameters:
* US state
* Date (year and month)
* Prenatal care start month
* Number of births
* Mother's average age (years)
* Average gestational age (weeks)
* Average infant birth weight (grams)

The full details on the data sets can be found here.

* Pandas for data analysis
* Numpy for data analysis
* Matplotlib for visualizations
* Seaborn for visualizations
* Folium for geographical visualization
* Json for geographical data points
